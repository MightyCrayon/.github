# About Mighty Crayon
## Who We Are
Our mission is to encourage enjoyable and empowering experiences for children around the world through the use of recycled creative mediums.
## What We Do
After seeing first hand the thousands of crayons that get thrown away after every kids meal in restaurants Mighty Crayon decided it was time for a change. We partnered with many restaurants all over the United States who joined our cause. Every month those restaurants save and send us their crayon which we then sort, sanitize, and pack. These crayons are then paired with coloring books and the packed “crayon care packages” are sent to kids in need locally, nationally, and globally.
